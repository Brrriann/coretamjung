# Detective Agency Website Project Blueprint

## Overview
This project aims to create a modern, high-trust, and professional website for a detective agency, inspired by the design and structure of `lawl-crime.co.kr`. The website will focus on reliability, professionalism, and immediate accessibility for clients needing sensitive investigations.

- **Typography:** Strong Sans-serif for headings (e.g., Montserrat or Inter), clean Serif for body text to evoke a "classic investigator" yet modern feel.
- **Visual Effects:**
    - Subtle noise texture on the background for a premium feel.
    - Deep, soft shadows for cards and interactive elements.
    - Subtle 3D elements (using Three.js) for a sophisticated atmosphere.
